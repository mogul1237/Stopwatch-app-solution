The goal of this lab is to understand the lifecycle of an activity and know the Handler class through building the Stopwatch app.
Activities
1. The Stopwatch app consists of a single activity and a single layout. The layout includes a text view showing you how much time has passed, a Start button that starts the stopwatch, a Stop button that stops it, and a Reset button that resets the timer value to zero.

2. Create a new Android project for an application named “Stopwatch”. The activity is called “StopwatchActivity” and a layout called “activity_stopwatch”.
3. The xml file for layout activity_stopwatch.xml is shown below:

4. The layout uses three extra String values, one for the text value of each button

5. Complete your source code to make your app work well. That means when the user changes the orientation of the device, the timer stills increments if it is already running. When the user clicks on the Start button, the timer starts; it stops when the app is partially obscured by another activity; and it starts again when the app is back in the foreground.

Attached please find the source code you might refer.
